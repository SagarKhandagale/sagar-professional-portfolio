(Well, doing anything with perfectness is one of my characteristicsüòâ). Initially, I was worried about my food situation. Then I decided to try things myself. Went on YouTube, typed the dish I was interested (Simple Indian Dal) and followed the steps. Surprisingly first dish that I made was near to perfect and after eating that my flatmates said 'We Never Ate Dal Like This BeforeüòÖ'. After that I learned many daily cuisine dishes and whenever I used to get the time, I used to cook special dish and feed it to everyone. I am glad that I was able to learn something completely new and mastering it.",

Traveling comes with many benefits, such as improved health and learning new skills. I had interest in going out and visiting new places since the time I was kid in a school. I used to be the first kid who was already for the school picnic.üòÖ My personal interest is more in exploring the nature, historical places, trekking and hiking to mountains (it is always hard for me to react the top, but the feeling after reaching at the top cannont be explainedüòå). I just love it. Journey and destination becomes more beautiful when you have your friends and family with you.üòä",

I had been to South of India whoch is the heart of beautiful indian temples üõï, North india where I went to Taj Mahal (One of the seven wonders of the world) and heavenly hills in himalayas, jungles in Jim Corbet, Nainital in East India, Goa which has the best beaches in india and many more. It has been always my dream to travel the world. I am still working on that. Visiting United States was like the childhood dream because I have been a huge fan of Hollywood movies. Last year I got that chance and I came here in Boston. I just love the city I am currently living in ‚ù§Ô∏è. Boston gives you the perfect combination of nature and city vibes. I have been to few places around the Boston but I really want to visit the New York. Study keeps me little busy these days but I am planning that soon. Let me know if you also want to join me. haha!!üòÖ",
