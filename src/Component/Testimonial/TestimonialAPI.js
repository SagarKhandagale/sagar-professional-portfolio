    desc: "Sagar was student of mine in Spring semester. During that class I got to know him closely. I find him curious and quick learner type of personality because he always used to ask doubts in class. He used to understand languages easily. He reached out to me for being a Teaching Assistant for my Summer course. I immidiately gave him the opportunity because I knew about his performance in the class. After becoming a TA he has performed really well. His tasks includes conducting practical lab session on topics taught in class, helping students by solving doubts, etc. I found his performance impressive so I offered him position of head TA for the upcoming semester. I believe his knowledge and skills are adding value to the coursework.",
